 * This class manages the storage of source code to be run by the executor, this will also handle the translation of

 * This class will receive source code from the bridge, in realtime if interactive or all at once if not.
 * If the program is not in interactive mode, this class should be the only one on the thread storing any source code
 * @param <SourceType> The type of source code, should match the type received by AExecutor
 * @param <LocationType> The type of locations, should match the type sent and received by AExecutor
 * @param <NameType> The type of names, should match the type sent by AExecutor
 * @param <RawSourceType> The type of the source sent by ABridge, may match SourceType (but doesn't have to)
 * @see AExecutor
